uMVC
====

A micro MVC framework for JavaScript applications.

I tweeted:

> You can write an MVC framework in one hundred lines of JavaScript & write about its effective use for one hundred thousand lines of English.

I wondered exactly how small I could write a respectable MVC framework that included the observer, composite, and strategy patterns.

Hopefully this code is educational for those new to the MVC paradigm.

If you are looking for a more fully-featured MVC framework that follows the same principles of uMVC to use in real browser applications, I suggest you take a look at [Maria](https://github.com/petermichaux/maria).
